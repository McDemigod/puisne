PUISNE - Portable UnINtruSive Executor

Package an executable & resources into a single file.

Description
    PUISNE is a combination executable stub & zip compressed archive in a single
    file. When executed, it will extract the archive content & execute a single
    "entrypoint" file contained therein.

    PUISNE aims to be "unintrusive"; it can be used as a drop-in replacement for
    the original executable; it will not typically intercept arguments or input
    intended for the packaged executable. Where possible, it aims to avoid
    littering the containing directory with archive contents.

Packages
    At a minimum, the archive should contain a folder with your application's
    name & a `.app` suffix (similar to MacOS application bundles). That folder
    should contain a file with the same name without the `.app` suffixed. That
    file will be the "entrypoint" executed by PUISNE. Note a blank application
    name, ie. a top-level folder named `.app/` is invalid & will cause an error.

Arguments
    Arguments are generally passed directly to the packaged executable. CLI
    arguments meant for PUISNE specifically must be specified explicitly by
    a leading `--`, eg.

        $ ./my_puisne.com -- -d directory

    A subsequent `--` ends PUISNE argument parsing; the remainder is passed to
    the packaged executable, eg.

        $ ./my_puisne.com -- -d directory -- --this=one_is_for_the_executable

    Later arguments take precedence over earlier ones (& see ".args" below).

    Nb. in the explanations below "working environment" refers to the directory
    containing the PUISNE, as determined by invocation, ie. `argv[0]`.

    -u unzip_option
        What files to extract from the archive. Available options are "all",
        "none", "new" (do not overwrite anything), "existing" (overwrite
        destination files but create none), "update" (create new files but
        overwrite files only if newer in the archive), & "freshen" (overwrite
        files newer in the archive but create none). Defaults to "update".
    -d destination
        Directory where to extract package content. Expands a leading `~` to the
        user's home directory if the shell has not already. Default differs
        between `-m` & `-n` flags.
    -m
        Mount extracted files [ over | under ] the working environment.
        This is only available with Linux kernel â‰¥ 5.12.0, where it is the
        default behavior. If not set with `-d`, defaults `destination` to
        `.puisne/app_name.app` in the working environment.
    -n
        No mount / not clean / naÃ¯ve; simply extracts files & executes. This is
        the default outside of environments where `-m` is available. Sets
        destination default to the working environment.
    -o overlay_option
        How to overlay destination. This effects where writes persist & what
        files the app "sees" if paths clash between the destination and working
        environment. "over", the default, attempts to isolate the app; writes
        persist to the destination & the app will see only working environment
        files that do not clash with the destination. "under" will prefer files
        in the working environment, & will write there as well; this option is
        appropriate for eg. analysis notebooks, which write intermediate files,
        figures, &c. into the working environment that the user will want
        readily available. Nb. this typically applies to files written by the
        app, but not its own files, which will be copied-on-write; use `-n` to
        persist these unequivocably.
    -w working_directory
        Working directory for the overlay mount; should be empty & on the same
        volume as the PUISNE. Defaults to a randomly generated temporary
        directory beginning with "puisne.".
    -h
        Print this help & exit.

.args
    A file named `.args` may be included at the top-level of the `zip`ped
    package. If found, arguments & options for PUISNE will be parsed from there
    (one per line). In general, this only occurs if no arguments are passed from
    the CLI. If, however, `.args` includes the special argument `...`, it is
    replaced with command-line arguments. Therefore, to set user-overridable
    defaults include them before `...` in `.args`; include the argument after
    `...` to force the argument, such that users cannot override it.
    NB. users are always free to update the `.args` itself. Also note, package
    arguments are split from PUISNE arguments before this occurs, so you cannot
    use `--` to specify default / force arguments to the packaged executable.

Examples
    Make a package; `my_app.app/my_app` exists & is executable:

        $ zip -r -D -g my_app.com my_app.app

    The example excludes explicit entries for directories with `-D`;  PUISNE
    will still make them with default flags, as needed. Furthermore, it "grows"
    the archive with `-g`, ie. it appends to the end of the existing content,
    rather than recreating the archive anew. This is necessary to maintain
    functionality in Windows, especially for small packages.

    Run a package, passing it `-a`:

        $ ./my_app.com -a

    Extract the package to a non-default directory, run it with `-a` passed:

        $ ./my_app.com -- -d extract/somewhere/else -- -a

    If the executable uses `--` to stop parsing arguments & pass those to some
    other application, and you have no other arguments to pass to the package,
    you need three `--`s in total so PUISNE does not intercept instead:

        $ ./my_puisne.com -- -- -- --internal_arg=too/much/indirection/stinks

Notes
    Additional archive contents
        Beyond the archive content already described, this help file is found at
        `puisne/help.txt` but should be left in place as it will be displayed
        either with the `-h` argument or if no package is found; generally users
        don't even need to know this is a PUISNE package & this can be left
        as-is.
        A folder containing timezone information is found at
        `usr/share/zoneinfo/` & is necessary for `-u freshen` or `-u update` to
        properly interpret timestamp.
        Any additional content found, ie. any other files or folders in the top
        level or multiple `.app` folders, are invalid & will cause an error.
